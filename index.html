            <h2>Reasons for Pursuing This Degree:</h2>
            <p>Initially, I was going into computer engineering, but I fell in love with the programming aspect of computer engineering so I switched to computer science. I just love programming so much and I have a huge interest in AI, software engineering, robotics, and cyber security. With that being said, my major is a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. I'm pursuing this degree because of my background as an electrician and to pursue my master's in Computer Engineering later down the road.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Reasons for Taking This Course:</h2>
            <p>Besides needing this class to graduate, I'm glad I was able to take this class because Software Engineering is more so the field of work I have a special interest in. I want to learn as many languages as I can but I'd like to gravitate more towards C++.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Current/Recent Job:</h2>
            <p>I recently finished my last contract with the United States Air Force, and during my time with them, I attained my journeyman status as an electrician.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Hobbies and Special Interests:</h2>
            <p>As far as hobbies, I'm a fairly simple dude—I love my dogs, I'm huge into reading comic books (Batman, Star Wars, and Manga). I build custom PCs, and I've built quite a bit of them for Chicago health clinics and gamers. I'm huge into futbol and boxing. I'm constantly putting myself into a lot of situations where I can further my education, so school has never really ended for me.</p>

            <h2>Fun Fact:</h2>
            <p>A fun fact about myself—I'm originally from Oaxaca, Oaxaca, Mexico. I came to the U.S. when I was a year old.</p>
