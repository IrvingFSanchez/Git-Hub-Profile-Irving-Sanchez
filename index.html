            <h2>The Who What and When:</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Hello Software Engineering. My name is Irving Sanchez,</strong><br> 
                <ul>
                    <li> A bit about myself--I am a senior who will be graduating with a <strong>B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics</strong> and thereafter pursuing my Masters in Computer Engineering.</li>
                    <li> I have two dogs, a Jack Russell Terrier "Groot" and a mini Dachshund "Peter", that I'm completely obsessed with.</li>
                    <li> My wife also graduated at Lewis University and is about to finish her Doctorates in Health Care and currently runs a mental health clinic.</li>
                    <li> Some of my goals and ambitions are to move my little family to Colorado Springs, Colorado and I'd also like to open up a boarding business that will cater to the upmost quality care in boarding and sheltering dogs.</li> 
                    <li> My career goal is to pursue my Masters in Computer Engineering. I'm profoundly passionate about my career field</li> 
                </ul> 
            </p>
            <p><strong>Enough about me, tell me about you! Or how we can collaborate!</strong></p>

            <h2>Reasons for Taking This Course:</h2>
            <p>Everything we do in life has a reason whether we know it or not, so to me, taking this class is a stepping stone in creating my professional profile.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Current/Recent Job:</h2>
            <p><strong>Currently my commitment is fully towards my degree and education but I do have a long history of work and recently finished my contract with the United States Air Force.</strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li> I spent roughly 10 years in the United States Air Force as an Electrician (3E051) and in between my time in service I have been working as an electrician throughout Illinois and Michigan</li>
            <li> My most recent job involved wiring up robotic assembly lines to PLC ran equipment. The primary goal was to build, troubleshoot, test and ship these to fortune 500 companies that needed to manufacture automobiles.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Hobbies and Special Interests:</h2>
            <p><strong>As far as hobbies, I'm a fairly simple dude</Strong><br>
                <ul>
                    <li> I love my dogs, Groot and Peter which I mentioned earlier.</li> 
                    <li> I'm huge into reading comic books (Batman, A Song of Ice and Fire, Star Wars, and Manga).</li>
                    <li> I build custom PCs, and I've built quite a bit of them for a long list of clients and businesses in Chicago.</li>
                    <li> I'm huge into futbol and boxing.
                    <li> I'm constantly putting myself into a lot of situations where I can further my education, so school has never really ended for me.</li>
                    <li> A self proclaimed nerd that plays Magic the Gathering and Chess</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
            </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Fun Fact:</h2>
            <p>Originally I am from Oaxaca, Mexico and came to the US as an infant--my father came to the United States under the Ronald Reagan Amnesty act which gave him an opportunity to get his citizenship. With that being said, I would be the first one in my family to pursue and graduate as a scholar.</p>
