            <h2>The Who What and When:</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Hello Software Engineering. My name is Irving Sanchez,</strong><br> 
                <ul>
                    <li> A bit about myself--I am a senior who will be graduating with a <strong>B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics</strong> and thereafter pursuing my Masters in Computer Engineering.</li>
                    <li> I also spent roughly 10 years in the United States Air Force as an Electrician (3E051) and in between my time in service I have been working as an electrician throughout Illinois and Michigan</li>
                    <li> Originally I am from Oaxaca, Mexico and came to the US as an infant--my father came to the United States under the Ronald Reagan Amnesty act which gave him an opportunity to get his citizenship. With that being said, I would be the first one in my family to pursue and graduate as a scholar.</li>
                    <li> I have two dogs, a Jack Russell Terrier "Groot" and a mini Dachshund "Peter", that I'm completely obsessed with.</li>
                    <li> My wife also graduated at Lewis University and is about to finish her Doctorates in Health Care and currently runs a mental health clinic.</li>
                    <li> Some of my goals and ambitions are to move my little family to Colorado Springs, Colorado and I'd also like to open up a boarding business that will cater to the upmost quality care in boarding and sheltering dogs.</li> 
                    <li> My biggest goal is to pursue my Masters in Computer Engineering--I am profoundly passionate about Engineering.</li> 
                </ul> 
            </p>
            <p><strong>Enough about me, tell me about you!</strong></p>

            <h2>Reasons for Taking This Course:</h2>
            <p>Everything we do in life has a reason whether we know it or not, so to me, taking this class is a stepping stone in creating my professional profile.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Current/Recent Job:</h2>
            <p>I recently finished my last contract with the United States Air Force, and during my time with them, I attained my journeyman status as an electrician.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Hobbies and Special Interests:</h2>
            <p>As far as hobbies, I'm a fairly simple dudeâ€”I love my dogs, I'm huge into reading comic books (Batman, Star Wars, and Manga). I build custom PCs, and I've built quite a bit of them for Chicago health clinics and gamers. I'm huge into futbol and boxing. I'm constantly putting myself into a lot of situations where I can further my education, so school has never really ended for me. I'm also an Elden Lord--if you know you know.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Fun Fact:</h2>
            <p>A fun fact about myselfâ€”I'm originally from Oaxaca, Oaxaca, Mexico. I came to the U.S. when I was a year old.</p>
