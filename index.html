            <p>[As far as hobbies, I'm a fairly simple dude--I love my dogs, I'm huge into reading comic books (Batman, Star Wars, and Manga). I build custom PC's and I've built quite a bit of them for Chicago health clinics and gamers. I'm huge into futbol, and boxing. I'm constantly putting myself into a lot of situations where I can further my education, so school has never really ended for me. ]</p>
