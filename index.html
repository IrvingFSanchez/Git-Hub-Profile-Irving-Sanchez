			<h2>Year at Lewis: [4]</h2>
			<h2>Lewis major/minor/concentrations: B.S. Computer Science, Minor in Mathematics</h2>
			<h2>Reasons for pursuing this degree: Why I'm pursuing this degree--initially I was going into computer engineering, but I fell in love with the programming aspect of computer engineering so I switched to computer science. I just love programming so much and I have a huge interest in AI, software engineering, robotics and cyber security. With that being said my major is a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. I'm pursing this degree because of my background as an electrician and to pursue my masters in Computer Engineering later down the road.</h2>

            <h2>Reasons for Taking This Course</h2>
            <p>[Besides needing this class to graduate, I'm glad I was able to take this class because Software Engineering is more so the field of work I have a special interest in. I want to learn as many languages I can but I'd like to gravitate more towards C++.]</p>

            <p>Current/Recent Job</p>

            <h2>Hobbies and Special Interests</h2>
            <p>As far as hobbies, I'm a fairly simple dude--I love my dogs, I'm huge into reading comic books (Batman, Star Wars, and Manga). I build custom PC's and I've built quite a bit of them for Chicago health clinics and gamers. I'm huge into futbol, and boxing. I'm constantly putting myself into a lot of situations where I can further my education, so school has never really ended for me.</p>
